# sklearn-decision-tree-iris

In this project, we will classify our data with the Decision Tree technique using the iris dataset, one of the most popular datasets often used for machine learning.

Decision tree is one of the supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification and regression problems. Decision tree is a powerful algorithm that can be used in complex problems. It is also the main building block of the Random Forest algorithm, which is one of the most powerful algorithms today.

Decision trees predict a class (classification) or a value (regression) based on rules formed after studying the data.
